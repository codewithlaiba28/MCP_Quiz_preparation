## Quiz: OpenAI Agents SDK – MCP Integration

1. **What does MCP (Model Context Protocol) standardize?**
   A) How LLMs train on datasets
   B) How applications expose tools & context to language models
   C) The format of model checkpoints
   D) The way prompts are cached in OpenAI’s API

   **Answer:** B ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

2. **Which transport options does the OpenAI Agents SDK support for MCP servers?**
   A) Streamable HTTP, HTTP with SSE, and Stdio
   B) FTP, SMTP, and WebSocket
   C) Only local in‑process calls
   D) Only WebSocket

   **Answer:** A — Streamable HTTP, HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE), and standard input/output (stdio). ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

3. **Why would you enable `cache_tools_list=True` when configuring an MCP server in the SDK?**
   A) To permanently store tool outputs locally
   B) To reduce network latency by avoiding repeated `list_tools()` calls
   C) Because it encrypts tool schemas for security
   D) Because it prevents tool calls altogether

   **Answer:** B ([Anakin.ai][2])

4. **How can you manually refresh the cached tool list on an MCP server instance?**
   A) By calling `invalidate_tools_cache()` on the server
   B) By restarting the agent process
   C) By sending a special HTTP header on next call
   D) By reinitializing the SDK library

   **Answer:** A ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

5. **What is the purpose of “tool filtering” in the context of MCP + Agents SDK?**
   A) To reduce the number of HTTP connections
   B) To control which tools from the MCP server are exposed to the agent
   C) To compress tool schema data
   D) To log every tool call for analytics

   **Answer:** B ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

6. **What is a static tool filter?**
   A) A filter that changes tool set at runtime based on agent name
   B) A filter defined at initialization time using fixed allow / block lists
   C) A filter that caches tool output
   D) A filter that is automatically generated by the server

   **Answer:** B ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

7. **What is a dynamic tool filter?**
   A) A filter that uses a runtime function (sync/async) to decide if a tool should be exposed
   B) A filter that permanently hides all tools after first use
   C) A filter that disables caching
   D) A filter that changes the transport protocol

   **Answer:** A — dynamic tool filters let you use a callable that checks run context, agent instance, etc. ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

8. **Why might you choose a dynamic tool filter over a static one?**
   A) Because the static filter always causes high latency
   B) Because you want to allow or restrict tools based on runtime factors like the agent’s identity or run context
   C) Because dynamic filters encrypt tool names
   D) Because dynamic filters are required by the SDK

   **Answer:** B ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

9. **What MCP methods support “prompts” integration in the Agents SDK?**
   A) `call_tool(name, args)` and `get_status()`
   B) `list_prompts()` and `get_prompt(name, arguments)`
   C) `start_trace()` and `end_trace()`
   D) `connect()` and `disconnect()`

   **Answer:** B — MCP servers supporting prompts can list and fetch prompt templates. ([OpenAI GitHub][1])

10. **Which of the following is a major benefit of integrating MCP servers into an Agent?**
    A) The agent can use external tools defined outside its local codebase
    B) The agent no longer needs to use Pydantic models
    C) The agent becomes fully offline and doesn’t call any remote service
    D) The agent’s training data is automatically updated

    **Answer:** A — MCP lets agents call external tools via standardized protocol. ([Corti.com][3])
